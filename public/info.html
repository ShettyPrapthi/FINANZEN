                                                    the customer at his or her discretion.

                                                    Types of accounts include savings accounts, which are designed to

                                                <p>A debit card is a payment card that deducts money directly from a
                                                    consumer’s checking account when it is used. Also called “check
                                                    cards”
                                                    or "bank cards," they can be used to buy goods or services; or to
                                                    get
                                                    cash from an automated teller machine or a merchant who'll let you
                                                    add
                                                    an extra amount onto a purchase.</p>
                                                <br>
                                                <h2>How a Debit Card Works</h2>
                                                <p>debit card is usually a rectangular piece of plastic, resembling any
                                                    charge card. It is linked to the user's checking account at a bank
                                                    or
                                                    credit union. The amount of money that can be spent with it is tied
                                                    to
                                                    the account size (the amount of funds in the account).
                                                    In a sense, debit cards work as a cross between ATM cards and credit
                                                    cards. You can use them to get cash from a bank's automated teller
                                                    machine, as with the former; or you can make purchases with them,
                                                    like
                                                    the latter. In fact, many financial institutions are replacing their
                                                    plain vanilla, single-purpose ATM cards with debit cards that are
                                                    issued
