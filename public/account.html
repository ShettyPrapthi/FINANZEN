            <h4>Choose a Bank or Credit Union</h4>
            <p>You might already know where you want to bank even if you aren’t yet sure of the steps to open an account
                there. If not, shop around. Start by finding the best match for your immediate need (a checking account
                or savings account, for example). As you compare institutions, be mindful of account usage restrictions
                and fees, which can quickly add up.

                There are three basic categories of financial institutions:</p>

            <p>Banks, including community banks and big banks: These might be well-known brands in your local community
                (or nationwide). They offer most of the basic services you need.2 3 Local and regional banks tend to
                have more friendly fee structures, but it may be possible to get fees waived at big banks.4
                Credit unions: A credit union is a customer-owned financial institution that provides many of the same
                services and products that banks provide. If you opt to join one of these not-for-profit institutions,
                you'll often enjoy competitive rates because they're not necessarily trying to maximize profits. But
                that’s not always the case—so review fee schedules carefully.
                Online banks and credit unions: These institutions operate entirely online. There’s no branch to visit
                (or pay for), and you’ll handle most service requests yourself. If you have access to and are
                comfortable using a computer or mobile device—and performing basic banking transactions—an online bank
                can help you reduce your fees, earn higher interest rates on savings accounts, and even get free
                checking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="2">
            <br>
            <h4>Visit the Bank Branch or Website</h4>
            <p>If you have access to a computer or mobile device and an internet connection, you can open an account by
                visiting the institution’s website. Search for the bank online, or visit the website listed on the
                bank's marketing materials.</p>
            <p>Generally, banks are required to verify your identity when you open an account. If you don’t have a
                government-issued ID, however, you may be able to use another form of ID. Ask your bank what other forms
                of identification it can accept.

                Similarly, if you don’t have a Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number
                (ITIN), some financial institutions will accept a passport number from the issuing country, an alien
                identification card number, or another government-issued ID number.</p>

            <h4>Pick the Product You Want</h4>
            <p>Once you determine the bank where you want to open an account, you'll generally have a variety of account
                types and services to choose from, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Checking accounts: Use these for making payments and receiving direct deposits.</li>
                <li>Savings accounts: These accounts allow you to earn interest.</li>
                <li>Money market accounts: These products sometimes earn slightly more interest than savings accounts
                    (while maintaining your access to cash).</li>
                <li>Loans: Depending on your credit score and payment history, you may be able to take out one of
                    several types of loans (auto, home, personal loans, for example).</li>
            </ul>
