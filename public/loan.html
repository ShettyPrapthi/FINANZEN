            <h4>What Is a Loan?</h4>
            <p></p>The term loan refers to a type of credit vehicle in which a sum of money is lent to another party in
            exchange for future repayment of the value or principal amount. In many cases, the lender also adds interest
            and/or finance charges to the principal value which the borrower must repay in addition to the principal
            balance. Loans may be for a specific, one-time amount, or they may be available as an open-ended line of
            credit up to a specified limit. Loans come in many different forms including secured, unsecured, commercial,
            and personal loans.</p>

            <p>Banks, including community banks and big banks: These might be well-known brands in your local community
                (or nationwide). They offer most of the basic services you need.2 3 Local and regional banks tend to
                have more friendly fee structures, but it may be possible to get fees waived at big banks.4
                Credit unions: A credit union is a customer-owned financial institution that provides many of the same
                services and products that banks provide. If you opt to join one of these not-for-profit institutions,
                you'll often enjoy competitive rates because they're not necessarily trying to maximize profits. But
                that’s not always the case—so review fee schedules carefully.
                Online banks and credit unions: These institutions operate entirely online. There’s no branch to visit
                (or pay for), and you’ll handle most service requests yourself. If you have access to and are
                comfortable using a computer or mobile device—and performing basic banking transactions—an online bank
                can help you reduce your fees, earn higher interest rates on savings accounts, and even get free
                checking.</p>

            <p>Once you determine the bank where you want to open an account, you'll generally have a variety of account
                types and services to choose from, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Checking accounts: Use these for making payments and receiving direct deposits.</li>
                <li>Savings accounts: These accounts allow you to earn interest.</li>
                <li>Money market accounts: These products sometimes earn slightly more interest than savings accounts
                    (while maintaining your access to cash).</li>
                <li>Loans: Depending on your credit score and payment history, you may be able to take out one of
                    several types of loans (auto, home, personal loans, for example).</li>
